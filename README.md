    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes

            TUTOR QUESTION: Is the h2 at the footer out of order because there are h3s above it?

THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

            TUTOR QUESTION: What about when size my screen down??? Text overlaps images

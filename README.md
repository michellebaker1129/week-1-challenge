## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

I refactored this site to improve web accessibility, with a goal of communicating more clearly to a wider audience.

>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

I researched principles of web accessibility to understand how the website measured met web accessibility standards. I found that I could improve on several components using the HTML and CSS I have already learned. Then I explored applicable techniques and tools in HTML and CSS (with my expanding Google skills) that I could apply to the existing code.

## Updates in the Code

### HTML

-Added <meta description> attribute for screen readers
-Improved <title> for simplified browsing experience
-Verified that screen readers can understand the unique spelling of Horiseon, as well as the inline stylization of the company name in the header
-Appended alt="description" to images, describing the images that are important to the message, and allowing a screen reader to skip over unimportant images 
-Altered HTML lines to imitate wrapped text to improve the reading experience of the index file
-Confirmed that screen readers understand emoji, and that the emoji used showed a color contrast high enough for colorblind users

### CSS

-Replaced existing fonts with more visually accessible fonts
-Increased color contrast for colorblind readers
-Amended font sizing from pixels to relative sizing for users who have set their own desired root font size while maintaining the original site designer's font size relationships
-Enlarged line height to 1.5 or higher to make reading paragraphs more comfortable
-Ensured the page will be functional to those who prefer to read a print-out
